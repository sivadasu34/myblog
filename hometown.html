				<td>Temple</td>
				<td>The main contribution for temple construction was made by the King Chalukya Bheema I during 10th century. The Shiva lingam is called Someshwara as it is believed that this lingam has been installed by Lord Chandra. The color of the linga is believed to change according to the Lunar rays. In Full Moon days it changes into white and during Amavasya day, it turns into black in form.
